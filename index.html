    <p>Lorem <i>ipsum dolor</i> Publishing as a collective organiser was Lenins idea. In “Where to Begin,”
        written in 1901, he compared publishing to “scaffolding round a building
        under construction, which marks the contours of the structure and facilitates
        communication between the builders, enabling them to distribute the work
        and to view the common results achieved by their organised labour.”
    <p>
    <p>Scaffolding would also create the possibility of “unit[ing] the activists not by 
        a congress, which under those conditions would be too costly, but around a 
        newspaper published abroad and out of reach of the police.
